# Lights Game
This is a game in which the player spawns into a black screen and only has a small circle of visibility available.  The movement is controlled by mouse, and the objective is to seek out chests hidden around the screen that only become visible within a certain proximity.  Once the chest is retrieved, it is added to the player's score and a new chest is randomly spawned in another location.  Every 10 seconds, a player-tracking AI enemy is spawned in, and if the player is touched by the enemy, the game is over.  The enemies progressively get faster as time progresses, and when the game is over the total time the player survived is displayed, as well as how many chests were collected in that time.
